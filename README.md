# Snake Game

![demo](/demo.png)

A snake game developed using React. Because I am(was) new to React, the project idea and implementation are hugely based on the snake game project created by Cl√©ment Mihailescu (the original github [repo](https://github.com/clementmihailescu/Snake-Game-Reverse-LL-Tutorial)).

## Game Description

The user guides the snake to the food using arrow keys until the snake eats itself or hits the boundary. To get a taste of the game, click [here](https://g.co/kgs/1REeC2).

## Add-on(s)

The game has a editable possibility to generate food that can reverse the snake's moving direction.
